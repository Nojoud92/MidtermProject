# Developing a model to describe bacteria growth
###### by Nojoud Almohanna

## Description

One important dynamical process in Microbiology is the growth of populations of organisms like bacteria. They reproduce through binary fission, which is a form of asexual reproduction, where single cells divide asexually into two cells, subsequently the two cells divide to form four cells, and so on. The time required for a cell to mature, and divide is approximately the same for any two cells. The increase in a bacterial population is described by a discrete dynamical system model. The goal of this project is to understand and analyze bacterial growth.

## The following topics will be covered in this project:

- Developing a model from experimental data
- Fitting a linear model to population change versus density
- Predicting bacterial growth under dynamic conditions
